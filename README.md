Hi! This is a project developed with the intention to **learn** and **improve** my developer habilits, I did this project with the help of @papodedev, an tutorial video on youtube.

The main goals here were to train the basics of HTML and CSS.

Nice things that could be learned from this project:

- Flexbox concepts
    - We covered the basics of flexbox, like: flex-direction, justify-content and align-items
- How to integrate with google maps
    - The site contract section uses a map to show the address, for that we used google maps integration and documentation.
- Media queries
    - All the site is responsive for smarphones, tablets and desktops.
